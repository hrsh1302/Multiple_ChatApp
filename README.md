# Multiple Chat App

This Java application consists of a simple chat server and client implementation using sockets. The server allows multiple clients to connect, each running in a separate thread, and facilitates communication between them. Clients can send and receive messages in a group chat environment.

## How to Run

1. Ensure that the Java Development Kit (JDK) is installed on your system.
2. Launch the server by executing the `Server.java` class first. The server will start listening on port 1234.
3. Once the server is running, launch the `Client.java` application with as many clients as you need (make sure to allow multiple instances of `Client.java` to be run)
4. Enjoy!

## Features
- **Real-time Communication:** Messages are sent and received in real-time, allowing users to chat seamlessly using the terminal.
- **Notifications:** Users are aware when a client has joined or has left the chat room
- **Simple Design:** Making communication simple
